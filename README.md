# euler_sphere_packing
This is my solution to Project Euler's Challenge #222: Sphere Packing.
Source: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler222/problem 

The problem statement is as follows: 
What is the length of the shortest pipe, of internal radius R mm, that can fully contain n balls of radii ri mm where 0 <= i < n-1?
The answer should be in micrometers rounded to nearest integer
